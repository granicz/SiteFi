WebSharper 2010 Standard is now available through [Visual Studio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/), complementing among others the great [F# templates](http://bloggemdano.blogspot.com/2010/08/f-templates-now-on-visual-studio.html) from [Daniel](http://bloggemdano.blogspot.com/), and those announced in [Don's earlier article](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/07/29/some-f-project-templates-available-online.aspx).
You can either search for WebSharper in the Extension Manager (under Tools) in Visual Studio 2010, or go to the [Gallery page](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/288b94ea-0ea7-4dde-8906-f72eb22fbe1b) directly.

Click Download, walk through the couple steps of the installer, and you are good to go. The Gallery page also provides a few quick pointers, but be sure to check out the WebSharper [main page](http://www.intellifactory.com/products/wsp/Home.aspx) and the [demos page](http://www.intellifactory.com/products/wsp/Samples.aspx) to get started.
