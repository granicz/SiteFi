Earlier this week I gave a talk at the first [London WebSharper User Group](http://skillsmatter.com/user-group/ajax-ria/websug) meetup about WebSharper 2.0 and some of its new features such as sitelets and the new Visual Studio templates. This was a longer, class-like talk with many technical points discussed - a great source of information for anyone interested in WebSharper. Here is the short summary of the talk:

>Introducing WebSharper 2.0
>
>WebSharper 2.0 is a web application development platform for F# that targets client-based rich internet applications. It integrates proven functional programming ideas and language- oriented programming to enable developing web applications that contain significantly less code and are quicker to develop and easier to maintain than their traditional counterparts. WebSharper comes with a proven F# to JavaScript compiler, full Visual Studio and ASP.NET integration, automatic resource management and
>tracking, single-click deployment, a continuously growing set of extensions for third-party JavaScript technologies (jQuery, YUI, Ext Js, Google Maps/Visualization, Infovis, etc.), and tools to develop new extensions and extend language/library coverage
>easily. 
>
>With WebSharper you can:
>  * Develop client-based Ajax web applications entirely in F#
>  * Write the client and server code side-by-side in a single language
>  * Compose user input forms, sequences of input forms, and even entire web sites declaratively as first-class values
>  * Use the full F# language, its core libraries and many .NET namespaces for client-side code
>  * Integrate seamlessly with existing ASP.NET applications
>  * Utilize any JavaScript technology via F# code
>  * Develop highly optimized JavaScript code in F#
>  * and much-much more
>
>In this event you will learn about:
>  * Getting Started with WebSharper
>  * The functional programming foundation for its main features
>  * How to compose HTML with combinators
>  * How to define basic and more advanced user input forms declaratively
>  * How to enlist external JavaScript libraries into type-safe F# and WebSharper code
>  * How to provide further library coverage for.NET code
>  * How to turn F# applications to WebSharper web applications
>  * How to extend legacy web applications with client-based functionality
>  * Best practices of developing larger applications with WebSharper
