This is your last chance to grab your ticket for [Tech Mesh 2012](http://techmeshconf.com/), a great new conference for upcoming technologies and programming languages, taking place in London, UK between Dec 4 and 6!  It's going to be an excellent and exciting event and I can't wait to demo our [WebSharper work on integrating with the Facebook API](http://techmeshconf.com/techmesh-london-2012/presentation/Developing%20and%20Integrating%20WebSharper%20Applications%20with%20Facebook).  Drop me a message on FPish (adam.granicz) or on Twitter (@granicz) if you want to meet up during the conference, I'll be in London until the 6th.

The conference features various tracks of talks, including Banking, Gaming and Social Media, Infrastructure and Messaging, Languages, Next-Generation Analytics, Databases, and Scalability/Multicore, and has a great line of speakers including language designers and technology pioneers. This is definitely the event you don't want to miss if you are a functional programmer!

So hurry and grab your seat while they last!  See you there!
