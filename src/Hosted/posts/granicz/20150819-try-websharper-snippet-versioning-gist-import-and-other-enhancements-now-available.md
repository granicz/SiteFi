A new [Try WebSharper](http://try.websharper.com) is out adding a couple handy new features and addressing a couple annoyances, making it even more easy to publish your F# and WebSharper snippets. The picture below depicts the main areas of change:

1. **Creating snippets from GitHub gists** - You can now easily import a gist, all you have to do is hover over the `(+)` button in the bottom right corner, hit the GitHub icon and give your gist URL.

2. **Versioning snippets** - You can now track different versions of and updates to any given snippet by switching stepping back and forth using the `<` and `>` arrows in the main menu.  By default, when you visit a snippet you see its latest version, unless the URL includes the exact version (`0` being the oldest), such as `http://try.websharper.com/snippet/adam.granicz/00002I/1`.

3. **Proper indentation support** - You may have noticed earlier that highlighting a block of text and hitting `Tab` or `Shift+Tab` doesn't exactly behave in a friendly manner: it wipes the selected text instead of indenting.  This is now fixed and you get the usual indentation behaviour you'd expect.

4. **Easy embed links** - If you need to embed a snippet or "run" it outside of Try WebSharper, you can now easily get those links by following the direct links on the Embed tab.
