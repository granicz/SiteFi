You may have heard that Don, Antonio and I have teamed up again to work on Expert F# 3.0, doing a comprehensive update with quite a bit of changes, and adding a good amount of new material to the book's first and second edition.

We are also **looking for a technical reviewer** who will read the full text, try out all samples, check all the code for correctness and formatting, and do all the other chores technical reviewer usually do.  If you are interested and would like to be considered, and have a good amount of free time on your hands, please drop me a message here on FPish or contact either one of us via email.  Thanks!
