Following [my previous blog entry](https://forums.websharper.com/blog/84332) about WebSharper.OAuth, I wrote a simple template application that you can use as a base to create your own OAuth-based app. [Check out the source](https://github.com/dotnet-websharper/oauth-app), or [see it in action](http://websharperoauthexample.azurewebsites.net/).

It features a landing page, a login page, and a private section. It also shows how to query the login provider's API for user information. Also check the Readme, which contains a configuration guide, a walkthrough of the code and a mini-tutorial on how to extend it with a new page.

Happy coding!
